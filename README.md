## ytv4.1-validation.py

### Library Change:
I have update the GUI **(ytv4.1-validation.py)** with the following changes:

The `HTTP 404: Bad Request` error originates from `pytube` which typically occurs when it tries to fetch a YouTube video's metadata and encounters issues with the URL or the request itself. This can happen due to:

1. **URL Format**: `pytube` may be more sensitive to the exact format of the video URL, while `yt_dlp` can handle some variations and redirects more gracefully.

2. **Changes in YouTube's API**: YouTube frequently updates its API and site structure. `pytube` might lag in updates, leading to errors when it encounters unexpected changes. `yt_dlp` is often updated more quickly to adapt to these changes.

3. **Error Handling**: `yt_dlp` has more robust error handling and fallback mechanisms, allowing it to manage errors better when fetching video information.

4. **Request Headers**: `yt_dlp` may send different or more comprehensive request headers that comply better with YouTube's requirements, reducing the likelihood of encountering a 404 error.

In summary, `yt_dlp` is generally more resilient to variations and changes in YouTube's backend, leading to fewer issues compared to `pytube`.

### Quality Selection:
In the second version, a new button ("Check Available Formats") is added to check and load available video formats dynamically based on the provided URL. This improves user experience by allowing users to see which qualities are available before attempting to download.

### Dynamic Quality Loading:
The quality selection (`quality_combobox`) is initially empty and populated only after checking available formats, ensuring users only see relevant options.

### Detailed Download Progress:
The second version includes more comprehensive download status updates, including speed, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and the size of the downloaded file, improving user feedback during downloads.

### Safe GUI Updates:
Introduced `safe_gui_update` method to ensure GUI updates are performed safely from different threads, preventing potential issues with thread safety in Tkinter.

### Improved Error Handling:
More robust error handling is implemented, specifically checking for video availability and improving messages based on common errors (e.g., video not found, private videos).

### User Interface Enhancements:
- Additional status labels for speed, ETA, and size are added, providing users with more information during the download process.
- Better use of layout and spacing to enhance the overall UI.

### File Name Formatting:
Improved file naming during download with specific template configurations in `ydl_opts`, ensuring clearer output file names.

### Code Structure and Clarity:
Code is generally more organized, with methods clearly defined for specific functionalities (like checking formats, downloading, and formatting sizes).

### Removed Redundant Code:
The second version eliminates some redundant checks and simplifies the logic for checking available formats and starting downloads.

Overall, these changes contribute to a more user-friendly, robust, and efficient video downloading application. Updated version eliminating the HTTP 404: Bad Request error. Improve error handling, enabling dynamic loading of available video formats. Additionally, the UI is refined with improved layout and additional status labels, while file naming during downloads is better organized. Overall, these changes create a more user-friendly and efficient application.
