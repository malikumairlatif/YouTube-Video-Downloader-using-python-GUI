### Library Change:
The first version uses `pytube`, while the second uses `yt_dlp`, which is generally more robust for downloading YouTube videos.

### User Interface Enhancements:
- Additional status labels for speed, ETA, and size are added, providing users with more information during the download process.
- Better use of layout and spacing to enhance the overall UI.

### File Name Formatting:
Improved file naming during download with specific template configurations in `ydl_opts`, ensuring clearer output file names.

### Code Structure and Clarity:
Code is generally more organized, with methods clearly defined for specific functionalities (like checking formats, downloading, and formatting sizes).

### Removed Redundant Code:
The second version eliminates some redundant checks and simplifies the logic for checking available formats and starting downloads.
